    "Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In other words, it is a mathematical discipline to collect, summarize data. Also, we can say that statistics is a branch of applied mathematics. However, there are two important and basic ideas involved in statistics; they are uncertainty and variation. The uncertainty and variation in different fields can be determined only through statistical analysis. These uncertainties are basically determined by the probability that plays an important role in statistics. Statistics is simply defined as the study and manipulation of data. As we have already discussed in the introduction that statistics deals with the analysis and computation of numerical data. Let us see more definitions of statistics given by different authors here.According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, statistics is defined as “classified facts representing the conditions of a people in a state – especially the facts that can be stated in numbers or any other tabular or classified arrangement”."

    "Types of Statistics in Maths\n",
    "Statistics have majorly categorised into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Descriptive statistics\n",
    "2. Inferential statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "In the descriptive Statistics, the Data is described in a summarized way. The summarization is done from the sample of the population using different parameters like Mean or standard deviation. Descriptive Statistics are a way of using charts, graphs, and summary measures to organize, represent, and explain a set of Data. \n",
    "1. Data is typically arranged and displayed in tables or graphs summarizing details such as histograms, pie charts, bars or scatter plots.\n",
    "2. Descriptive Statistics are just descriptive and thus do not require normalization beyond the Data collected.\n",
    "Eg. Mean, Median and Mode in Statistics\n",
    "Mean: Mean is considered the arithmetic average of a Data set that is found by adding the numbers in a set and dividing by the number of observations in the Data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The middle number in the Data set while listed in either ascending or descending order is the Median. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The number that occurs the most in a Data set and ranges between the highest and lowest value is the Mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics\n",
    "In the Inferential Statistics, we try to interpret the Meaning of descriptive Statistics. After the Data has been collected, analyzed, and summarised we use Inferential Statistics to describe the Meaning of the collected Data. \n",
    "1. Inferential Statistics use the probability principle to assess whether trends contained in the research sample can be generalized to the larger population from which the sample originally comes.\n",
    "2. Inferential Statistics are intended to test hypotheses and investigate relationships between variables and can be used to make population predictions.\n",
    "3. Inferential Statistics are used to draw conclusions and inferences, i.e., to make valid generalizations from samples.\n",
    "Example: Inferential statistics\n",
    "You randomly select a sample of 11th graders in your state and collect data on their SAT scores and other characteristics.\n",
    "You can use inferential statistics to make estimates and test hypotheses about the whole population of 11th graders in the state based on your sample data.\n",

    "Ordinal data.\n",
    "Discrete data.\n",
    "Continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative or Categorical Data\n",
    "Qualitative or Categorical Data is data that can’t be measured or counted in the form of numbers. These types of data are sorted by category, not by number. That’s why it is also known as Categorical Data. These data consist of audio, images, symbols, or text. The gender of a person, i.e., male, female, or others, is qualitative data.\n",

    "Nominal Data\n",
    "Nominal Data is used to label variables without any order or quantitative value. The color of hair can be considered nominal data, as one color can’t be compared with another color.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name “nominal” comes from the Latin name “nomen,” which means “name.” With the help of nominal data, we can’t do any numerical tasks or can’t give any order to sort the data. These data don’t have any meaningful order; their values are distributed into distinct categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ordinal data is qualitative data for which their values have some kind of relative position. These kinds of data can be considered “in-between” qualitative and quantitative data. The ordinal data only shows the sequences and cannot use for statistical analysis. Compared to nominal data, ordinal data have some kind of order that is not present in nominal data.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Quantitative Data\n",
    "Quantitative data can be expressed in numerical values, making it countable and including statistical data analysis. These kinds of data are also known as Numerical data. It answers the questions like “how much,” “how many,” and “how often.” For example, the price of a phone, the computer’s ram, the height or weight of a person, etc., falls under quantitative data. \n",

    "Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "Mean: The sum of all measurements divided by the number of observations.Can be used with discrete and continuous data. It is value that is most common\n",
    "Median: The middle value that separates the higher half from the lower half. Mean and median can be compared with each other to determine if the population is of normal distribution or not. Numbers are arranged in either ascending or descending order. The middle number is than taken.\n",
    "Mode: The most frequent value. It shows most popular option and is the highest bar in histogram.Example of use: to determine the most common blood group.\n",
    "Geometric mean - the nth root of the product of the data values.\n",
    "Harmonic mean - the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the data values.\n",

    "Variability (dispersion)\n",
    "Definition: dispersion is contrasted with location or central tendency, and together they are the most used properties of distributions.

    "Measures of variability\n",
    "Variance: A measure of how far a set of numbers are spread out from each other. It describes how far the numbers lie from the mean (expected value). It is the square of standard deviation.\n",
    "Standard deviation (SD): it is only used for data that are “normally distributed”. SD indicates how much a set of values is spread around the average. SD is determined by the variance (SD=the root of the variance).\n",
    "Interquartile range (IQR): the interquartile range (IQR), is also known as the 'midspread' or 'middle fifty', is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between the third and first quartiles. IQR = Q3 − Q1. Unlike (total) range, the interquartile range is a more commonly used statistic, since it excludes the lower 25% and upper 25%, therefore reflecting more accurately valid values and excluding the outliers.\n",
    "Range: it is the length of the smallest interval which contains all the data and is calculated by subtracting the smallest observation (sample minimum) from the greatest (sample maximum) and provides an indication of statistical dispersion. It bears the same units as the data used for calculating it. Because of its dependance on just two observations, it tends to be a poor and weak measure of dispersion, with the only exception being when the sample size is large."
